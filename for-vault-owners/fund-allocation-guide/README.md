# Fund Allocation Guide

This guide explains how vault managers allocate funds between the vault's idle account and initialized strategies.

## Overview

As a vault manager, you have the authority to:

* Deploy idle funds from the vault into active strategies
* Withdraw funds from strategies back to the vault
* Monitor current allocations and performance

## Key Concepts

### Idle vs. Deployed Funds

* **Idle Funds**: Assets sitting in the vault's idle token account, not earning yield
* **Deployed Funds**: Assets actively working in strategies (lending, trading, LP)
* **Total Assets**: Sum of idle and deployed funds

### Fund Flow

```
User Deposits → Vault Idle Account → Strategy Accounts
Strategy Accounts → Vault Idle Account → User Withdrawals
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep some funds idle to service user withdrawals. If all funds are deployed, users may experience delays during the withdrawal process.
