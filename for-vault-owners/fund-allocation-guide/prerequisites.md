# Prerequisites

Before allocating vault funds, ensure you have:

## 1. Manager Keypair & SOL

You need the **manager** keypair for your vault. The manager pays for fund allocation transaction fees.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **manager** pays gas fees for allocation transactions. Additionally, the manager pays rent for any Associated Token Accounts (ATAs) that need to be created during allocation. See [Gas Fees & ATA Costs](../vault-operations/gas-fees-and-ata-costs.md) for detailed cost breakdowns.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Solana RPC Endpoint

Access to a reliable Solana RPC endpoint (e.g., Helius, Triton, QuickNode).

## 3. Manager Role on the Vault

You must be the designated manager of the vault. Verify by checking the vault's `manager` field matches your keypair.

## 4. Initialized Strategies

Funds can only be allocated to **already initialized** strategies. If you haven't set up strategies yet, see [Strategy Setup Guide](../strategy-setup-guide/README.md).

## 5. SDK & Dependencies

```bash
npm install @voltr/vault-sdk @solana/web3.js @coral-xyz/anchor @solana/spl-token
```
